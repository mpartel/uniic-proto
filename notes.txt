The source language does not support lambdas yet. If they were implemented,
we'd want closed variables to be writable, and emulating that is not as simple
as emulating a read-only closure. I decided to save time.

We don't do Hindley-Milner to SSA because we want to detect borrowing
during typing, and there's no obvious way to do it with H-M.
We could use H-M if the user annotated borrowing sites by hand.



Some intuitions about polymorphic uniqueness attributes:

`x : forall u:A. T^u` means
  - x is effectively unique since we can cast x to T*

Taking a parameter T^u means
  - we accept both unique and non-unique parameters.
  - in the body of the function, u is rigid, unlike a variable forall u:A. T^u
  - if we return (or unborrow) T^u, then its uniqueness has been preserved

Returning x : T^u where u is unbounded means
  - x is effectively unique since we can cast the return value to T*



The rank-1 version of De Vries' system is problematic with
higher-order functions.
Consider:

    f : (forall u. Int -> T^u) -> T*
    f g = ...

With the rank-1 version, we lose the ability to
demand a function that returns T in any uniqueness.

Say we tried:

    f : forall u. (Int -> T^u) -> T*
    f g = ...

Now `g` would be useless since we cannot unify `u = *` (because `f` must now work for any `u`).

Clean's type system has subtyping so it's much less reliant on rank-n types.
With De Vries' system, we can hack around the problem by doing

    f : forall u. (Int -> T*) -> T*
    f g' = let g = gen(g') in ...
